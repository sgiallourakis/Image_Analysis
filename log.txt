## Log for Crater Project ##

This log was created on March 5th/2025. Thus purpose of this project is to transfer what I have learned studying impact craters,
craters, karst structures to create a functioning image segmentation pipeline. The goal is to build a general purpose tool,
that also has the ability to be tailored to specific crater identification tasks.

## MARCH 5th, 2025 ##
Created Initial database to store images.
The database is setup to store images and the segments that are made from each image.
Created initial functions to get meta data from image.

NOTES:

Still need to write function to store images in the database.
Also need to make sure database users are setup correctly.
